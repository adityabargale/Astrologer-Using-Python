# 🔭 Astrologer: Zodiac Sign Finder & Daily Reading App 🔮

**Astrologer** is a simple, command-line Python application that determines a user's Western Zodiac sign based on their birth date and provides a randomized daily prediction and guidance tailored to that sign.

It's a great example of a beginner-to-intermediate Python project utilizing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, handling date inputs with the `datetime` module, and using data structures to manage astrological information.

## 🚀 Features

* **Zodiac Sign Determination:** Accurately calculates the user's Western Zodiac sign (e.g., *Libra ♎*, *Aries ♈*) from their full birth date.
* **Personalized Reading:** Provides a randomized **daily prediction** and a piece of **daily guidance** from pre-defined, sign-specific options.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures the user enters the birth date in the correct `DD-MM-YYYY` format.
* **Clear OOP Structure:** Utilizes `Person` and `Astrologer` classes to logically separate data and functionality.
